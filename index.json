Particularly, we propose a strategy that exploits the unpaired image style transfer capabilities of CycleGAN in semi-supervised segmentation. Unlike recent works using adversarial learning for semi-supervised segmentation, we enforce cycle consistency to learn a bidirectional mapping between unpaired images and segmentation masks. This adds an unsupervised regularization effect that boosts the segmentation performance when annotated data is limited. Experiments on three different public segmentation benchmarks (PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes and ACDC) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed model achieves 2-4% of improvement with respect to the baseline and outperforms recent approaches for this task, particularly in low labeled data regime.","tags":[],"title":"Revisiting CycleGAN for Semi-Supervised Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This paper proposes a novel GAN training technique to obtain a generative model that can be learned using a single image.

Though multi-mode prior or multigenerator models have been proposed to alleviate this problem, such approaches may fail depending on the empirically chosen initial mode components. In contrast to such bottom-up approaches, we present GAN-Tree, which follows a hierarchical divisive strategy to address such discontinuous multi-modal data. Devoid of any assumption on the number of modes, GAN-Tree utilizes a novel modesplitting algorithm to effectively split the parent mode to semantically cohesive children modes, facilitating unsupervised clustering. Further, it also enables incremental addition of new data modes to an already trained GAN-Tree, by updating only a single branch of the tree structure. As compared to prior approaches, the proposed framework offers a higher degree of flexibility in choosing a large variety of mutually exclusive and exhaustive tree nodes called GANSet. Extensive experiments on synthetic and natural image datasets including ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of GAN-Tree against the prior state-of-the-art.","tags":[],"title":"GAN-Tree: An Incrementally Learned Hierarchical Generative Framework for Multi-Modal Data Distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Aarush Gupta\u0026ast;**","**Dakshit Agrawal\u0026ast;**","Hardik Chauhan","Jose Dolz","Marco Pedersoli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533148200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533148200,"objectID":"bf6aa00b2908fd70c0daaf90170dea54","permalink":"https://vlgiitr.github.io/publication/att/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/att/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we propose a new approach for classifying the global emotion of images containing groups of people. To achieve this task, we consider two different and complementary sources of information: i) a global representation of the entire image (ii) a local representation where only faces are considered. While the global representation of the image is learned with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the local representation is obtained by merging face features through an attention mechanism. The two representations are first learned independently with two separate CNN branches and then fused through concatenation in order to obtain the final group-emotion classifier. For our submission to the EmotiW 2018 group-level emotion recognition challenge, we combine several variations of the proposed model into an ensemble, obtaining a final accuracy of 64.83% on the test set and ranking 4th among all challenge participants.","tags":[],"title":"An Attention Model for Group Level Emotion Recognition","type":"publication"}]
