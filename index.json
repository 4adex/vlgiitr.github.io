Companies' earnings calls are a rich, underexplored source of multimodal information for financial forecasting. However, existing fintech solutions are not optimized towards harnessing the interplay between the multimodal verbal and vocal cues in earnings calls. In this work, we present a multi-task solution that utilizes domain specialized textual features and audio attentive alignment for predictive financial risk and price modeling. Our method advances existing solutions in two aspects: 1) tailoring a deep multimodal text-audio attention model, 2) optimizing volatility, and price movement prediction in a multi-task ensemble formulation. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show the effectiveness of our deep multimodal approach.","tags":[],"title":"Multimodal Multi-Task Financial Risk Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Going deeper and deeper works, but only when we know what exactly to learn.

In contrast, we propose an end to end pipeline to learn all three policies using machine learning. We also take inspiration from the success of pretraining on large corpora to learn specialized embeddings for the task. We model prefetching as a sequence prediction task based on past misses. Following previous works suggesting that frequency and recency are the two orthogonal fundamental attributes for caching, we use an online reinforcement learning technique to learn the optimal policy distribution between two orthogonal eviction strategies based on them. While previous approaches used the past as an indicator of the future, we instead explicitly model the future frequency and recency in a multitask fashion with prefetching, leveraging the abilities of deep networks to capture futuristic trends and use them for learning eviction and admission. We also model the distribution of the data in an online fashion using Kernel Density Estimation in our approach, to deal with the problem of caching non-stationary data. We present our approach as a ”proof of concept” of learning all three components of cache strategies using machine learning and leave improving practical deployment for future work.","tags":[],"title":"DEAP Cache: Deep Eviction Admission and Prefetching for Cache","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aditya Nagori","Raghav Awasthi","Vineet Joshi","Suryatej Reddy Vyalla","Akhil Jarodia","Chandan Gupta","Amogh Gulati","Harsh Bandhey","Keerat Kaur Guliani*","Mehrab Singh Gill","Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","Tavpritesh Sethi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600021800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600021800,"objectID":"c312a616c6f676b33b0b9272d58740ae","permalink":"https://vlgiitr.github.io/publication/covision/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/covision/","section":"publication","summary":"COVID-19 pandemic is an enigma with uncertainty caused by multiple biological and health systems factors. Although many models have been developed all around the world, transparent models that allow interacting with the assumptions will become more important as we test various strategies for lockdown, testing and social interventions and enable effective policy decisions. In this paper, we developed a suite of models to guide the development of policies under different scenarios when the lockdown opens. These had been deployed to create an interactive dashboard called COVision which includes the Agent-based Models (ABM) and classical compartmental models (CCM). Our tool allows simulation of scenarios by changing the strength of lockdown, basic reproduction number(R0), asymptomatic spread, testing rate, contact rate, recovery rate, incubation period, leakage in lockdown etc. We optimized ABM and CCMs and evaluated them on multiple error metrics. Out of these models in our suite, ABM was able to capture the data better than CCMs. Our evaluation suggests that ABM models were able to capture the dynamic nature of the epidemic for a longer duration of time while CCMs performed inefficiently. We computed R0 using CCMs which were found to be decreasing with lockdown duration, indicating the effectiveness of policies in different states of India. Models have been deployed on a dashboard hosted at http://covision.tavlab.iiitd.edu.in which allows users to simulate outcomes under different parameters and will allow the policymakers to make informed decisions and efficient monitoring of the covid19 pandemic in India.","tags":[],"title":"Less Wrong COVID-19 Projections With Interactive Assumptions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raghav Awasthi","Keerat Kaur Guliani*","Arshita Bhatt","Mehrab Singh Gill","Aditya Nagori","Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","Tavpritesh Sethi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600021800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600021800,"objectID":"47da2d35e4d58ae5872d354fda5eccf5","permalink":"https://vlgiitr.github.io/publication/vacsim/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/vacsim/","section":"publication","summary":"A COVID-19 vaccine is our best bet for mitigating the ongoing onslaught of the pandemic. However, vaccine is also expected to be a limited resource. An optimal allocation strategy, especially in countries with access inequities and a temporal separation of hot-spots might be an effective way of halting the disease spread. We approach this problem by proposing a novel pipeline VacSIM that dovetails Actor-Critic using Kronecker-Factored Trust Region (ACKTR) model into a Contextual Bandits approach for optimizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine. Whereas the ACKTR model suggests better actions and rewards, Contextual Bandits allow online modifications that may need to be implemented on a day-to-day basis in the real world scenario. We evaluate this framework against a naive allocation approach of distributing vaccine proportional to the incidence of COVID-19 cases in five different States across India and demonstrate up to 100,000 additional lives potentially saved and a five-fold increase in the efficacy of limiting the spread over a period of 30 days through the VacSIM approach. We also propose novel evaluation strategies including a standard compartmental model based projections and a causality preserving evaluation of our model. Finally, we contribute a new Open-AI environment meant for the vaccine distribution scenario, and open-source VacSIM for wide testing and applications across the globe.","tags":[],"title":"VacSIM: Learning Effective Strategies for COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution using Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"This repo contains a list of topics which we feel that one should be comfortable with before appearing for a DL interview.

However, despite their superior performance, deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial perturbations, which can cause the network's prediction to change without making perceptible changes to the input image, thus creating severe security issues at the time of deployment of such systems. Recent works have shown the existence of Universal Adversarial Perturbations, which, when added to any image in a dataset, misclassifies it when passed through a target model. Such perturbations are more practical to deploy since there is minimal computation done during the actual attack.

While the recent advances in deep learning and the usage of deep neural networks have achieved near human accuracy on many tasks, there still exists a pretty big gap between human and machine level performance when it comes to various visual relationship detection tasks. Developing on earlier tasks like object recognition, segmentation and captioning which focused on a relatively coarser image understanding, newer tasks have been introduced recently to deal with a finer level of image understanding. A Scene Graph is one such technique to better represent a scene and the various relationships present in it. With its wide number of applications in various tasks like Visual Question Answering, Semantic Image Retrieval, Image Generation, among many others, it has proved to be a useful tool for deeper and better visual relationship understanding. In this paper, we present a detailed survey on the various techniques for scene graph generation, their efficacy to represent visual relationships and how it has been used to solve various downstream tasks. We also attempt to analyze the various future directions in which the field might advance in the future. Being one of the first papers to give a detailed survey on this topic, we also hope to give a succinct introduction to scene graphs, and guide practitioners while developing approaches for their applications.","tags":[],"title":"Visual Relationship Detection using Scene Graphs: A Survey","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The new blog on the topic Support Vector Machines by Aaryan Garg is now published on Medium.

Particularly, we propose a strategy that exploits the unpaired image style transfer capabilities of CycleGAN in semi-supervised segmentation. Unlike recent works using adversarial learning for semi-supervised segmentation, we enforce cycle consistency to learn a bidirectional mapping between unpaired images and segmentation masks. This adds an unsupervised regularization effect that boosts the segmentation performance when annotated data is limited. Experiments on three different public segmentation benchmarks (PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes and ACDC) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed model achieves 2-4% of improvement with respect to the baseline and outperforms recent approaches for this task, particularly in low labeled data regime.","tags":[],"title":"Revisiting CycleGAN for Semi-Supervised Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jaynil Jaiswal","Ashutosh Chaubey","Bhimavarapu Sasi Kiran Reddy","Shashank Kashyap","Puneet Kumar","Balasubramanian Raman","Partha Pratim Roy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572633000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572633000,"objectID":"85afa700c46556d599adceca179e3028","permalink":"https://vlgiitr.github.io/publication/gan-ensemble/","publishdate":"2019-11-02T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/gan-ensemble/","section":"publication","summary":"Coming Soon","tags":[],"title":"A Generative Adversarial Network based Ensemble Technique for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Synthesized Speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"GenZoo is a repository that provides implementations of generative models in various frameworks, namely Tensorflow and Pytorch.

Though multi-mode prior or multigenerator models have been proposed to alleviate this problem, such approaches may fail depending on the empirically chosen initial mode components. In contrast to such bottom-up approaches, we present GAN-Tree, which follows a hierarchical divisive strategy to address such discontinuous multi-modal data. Devoid of any assumption on the number of modes, GAN-Tree utilizes a novel modesplitting algorithm to effectively split the parent mode to semantically cohesive children modes, facilitating unsupervised clustering. Further, it also enables incremental addition of new data modes to an already trained GAN-Tree, by updating only a single branch of the tree structure. As compared to prior approaches, the proposed framework offers a higher degree of flexibility in choosing a large variety of mutually exclusive and exhaustive tree nodes called GANSet. Extensive experiments on synthetic and natural image datasets including ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of GAN-Tree against the prior state-of-the-art.","tags":[],"title":"GAN-Tree: An

While the global representation of the image is learned with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the local representation is obtained by merging face features through an attention mechanism. The two representations are first learned independently with two separate CNN branches and then fused through concatenation in order to obtain the final group-emotion classifier.
